					<li>I gave the website a makeover!</li>
					<li>I won't be doing a blog anymore!</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Yes indeed I will no longer be doing blogs. Why? Because I am super duper busy with college homework.</p>

				<p>Woah hi!! first blog post. Honestly I don't even know if this will work. <br />
				Yes I know right now things are not pretty. I have no knowledge on CSS so for now things are gonna be just a bunch of text.</p>
				<p> SO...  Today, I went to my first pride festival! My goodness!!! <br />
				It was alot for me to take in. I grew up in a deeply christian household that rejected any non-cis non-straight lifestyles and I had to hide who I was for a majority of my life. <br />
				Technically, I'm still partially hiding who I am. I still go by my deadname and dead pronouns, but only because I dont feel comfortable yet asking people to use she/they or call me Amy.<br />
				Maybe one day I can come out. I still havent acquainted myself with the QSA at my college. I'm kinda extremely socially anxious so I often just freeze when I am around other people.<br />
				But seeing so many people just be themselves and seeing a FURSUITER for the first time was so so so magical! I have only been able to connect to other trans and queer people online.<br />
				Finally seeing the wide range of people in-person was something so amazing. Seeing them, and seeing that they are <strong>REAL</strong>, was so awesome.</p>
				<p> Also! I got a job today! I had orientation but I will be starting my first college job at Dairy Queen! <br />
				I am very very nervous ;D but hopefully I can last long enough to make a good amount of money.</p>
				<p>Shoutout to my awesome girlfriend Danya for being very supportive of my journey!</p>
				<p>Thank you for reading. This is just something I might try out. Build up my individuality and whatnot :P</p>
